# Car-Price-Prediction
- we have Develop a model to help user predict car price.
- Dataset from Kaggle - [Car Features and MSRP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset)
# Car price prediction project summary
- Porject for predicting price of a car
- Download dataset from Kaggle 
- Cleand the dataset
- EDA to identify MSRP long tail
- Applied log tranform to make it normal distributed
- Split dataset 
- linear regression implementation 
- Expanded the LR to a generalized form 
- Machine learning is not magic - Just a formulae
- Baseline model using numerical features
- Metric to evaluate model = RSME 
- Validation the model using val dataset
- Feature engineering - categorical features into numerical binary features = 1 Hot Encoding
- RMSE is huge after including cat variables 
- Numerical stability due to feature engineering 
- Regularizaiton to stabilize the model 
- Tune the parameters to arrive at a final model 
- Finally, test the model on test dataset
